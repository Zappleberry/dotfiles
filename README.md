# openbox-dotfiles

## TODO

- Make speedy script for my use-case (set up symbolic links).
- Fix the GTK3/qt radio-button and check marks.

## Badwolf gtk theme

Badwolf is a theme I forked from [DarK by sixsixfive](https://gitlab.com/sixsixfive/DarK-theme). It looked nice and I wanted to make a badwolf color variant.

Currently the GTK3 or possibly qt framework doesn't like radio-buttons and check marks. Looking into fixing it.

## config

All my specific files for `~/.config/`, which is currently my openbox key-mapping, neofetch config, ranger (needs some updating), some beautification for rofi, and badwolf zathura "theme."

## Mistral-Openbox-Theme

The window decoration theme I am using. I think I modified it about 2018.02 for Badwolf color theme.

## rofi-themes

Badwolf theme for rofi. I used arc-red to make it.

## spacemacs

My spacemacs config. Build spacemacs with minimal install and ivy, only modifications are the font (Hack) and the theme (Badwolf).

## Xdefaults

Am using one of Luke Smith's Xdefaults that I modified to create mine. Unsure which of his I used (from a while ago).

## xinitrc

Not using this at the moment, will use in future use cases for launching bpswm.

## Xmodmap

Just remaps caps_lock and escape. It works fine, but getting lxde to launch it on startup is a pain.

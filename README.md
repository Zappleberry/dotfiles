Current void dotfiles

## .vimrc

vim configuration file. WIP as I need more things to get it to work for my workflow.

## Xdefaults

Am using a base16-ashes theme, modified to use transparancy.

## xinitrc

Not using this at the moment, will use in future use cases for launching bpswm.

## Xmodmap

Just remaps caps_lock and escape.

## Fonts

Contains siji bitmap font. I know that it can be enabled by setting:
`/etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf` to `/etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf.old` (disabling the file)
However, when I do this, it just causes some fonts to loose their aliasing. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I am looking into it.
